Set up AFPO, ran on toy problems.

TO DO: Write save functions, run actual experiments.

[2018-04-06]
Added tree based connection cost for network and morphology.

TO DO: Set up AFPO with save features etc.

[2018-04-05]
Initial entry.
Added tree, evolution, fitness function, etc.
Hill climber tests showed evolution can occur on 2 environments simultaneously.
Visual inspection shows the the robot performs similar actions meaning modularity is most likely not present.

TO DO: Assign nodes branches, write connection cost according to tree structure, visualization of network.
Run AFPO tests on multiple environments.
